# Question answer 1:

1. **Create a Hotfix Branch :** Assuming I am already in the main branch, create a new branch for hotfix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b hotfix/typo-in-recipe-instructions
   ```
2. **Work on the Hotfix :** Make the necessary changes to fix the issue that I am addressing. Once I have made my changes and tested them, commit my changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fixed typo in recipe instructions"
   ```

3. **Push the Hotfix Branch :** Push hotfix branch to the remote repository:

   ```bash
   git push origin hotfix/typo-in-recipe-instructions
   ```

4. **Create a Pull Request (PR) :** Go to Git platform and navigate to the repository. Create a new pull request, selecting my hotfix branch as the source branch and the production branch as the target branch.

5. **Review and Merge :** Wait for my team to review my changes. If everything looks good, merge my hotfix branch into the production branch.

6. **Resolve Conflicts (if any) :** If there are any conflicts during the merge, resolve them locally by checking out the production branch.

7. **Close the Hotfix Branch :** Once hotfix is merged and deployed, i will delete the hotfix branch

   ```bash
   git branch -d hotfix/typo-in-recipe-instructions
   ```

# Question answer 2:

1. Iterate Through Each Menu Collection
2. Iterate Through Categories in Each Menu Collection
3. Match Menu Item IDs with Menu Items
4. Retrieve Matching Menu Items
5. Store Results

#### Here's how I will resolve this without getting into the specifics of coding:

1. I need to implement nested looping to traverse through each menu collection and its categories.
2. Use conditional statements to check if the id of each menu item exists in the menuItemsIds array of a category.
3. I need to decide on an appropriate data structure to store the results. This could be an object where each key represents a category name, and the value is an array of menu items.
4. Depending on the size of the data and performance requirements, I might need to optimize algorithm to avoid unnecessary iterations or comparisons.
5. I should handle edge cases such as missing or invalid data gracefully to ensure the reliability of our solution.
